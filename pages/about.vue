            Hey! My name is Aleksandar.I am a web developer & web designer based in Skopje, Macedonia.
            I have been working as a freelance developer and web designer since 2021. Iâ€™ve always been someone who 
            has both a creative and a logical side. When I discovered web design, I realized it would 
            be the perfect fit. I could use my creative side to design and my logical side to code. 
            As a bonus, being both designer and developer allows me to make sure no detail is lost in translation.

          I'm currently working freelance for clients and frends.        
          I am also learning 
          <LinkBtn link="https://vuejs.org/" text="VueJS"/>
            and 
          <LinkBtn link="https://nuxt.com/" text="NuxtJs."/>
          Before this, I just
          used to create various 
          <LinkBtn link="https://laravel.com" text="Laravel"/>
          Blade web-apps to fulfill my needs. It has helped me
          polish my web-development skills.

          I started learning  web-development at 
          <LinkBtn link="https://brainster.co" text="Brainster Academy"/>, 
          where I was introduced to various web tehnologies like HTML, CSS, 
          Bootstrap, jQuery, MySQL and Laravel. 
          I quickly started writing  webpages for my friends
          and clients. After then I explore the web development world more and found many
          frameworks. Out of all, I found my love for NuxtJs. Since then, I've been
          mastering it, and with every new project I added a new tool, like
          <LinkBtn link="https://tailwindcss.com/" text="TailwindCSS"/>
           and more.
